        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the Meat</li>
            <dl>
                <dt>Marinating your chicken is essential to building full-flavored fajitas. 
                    You can use white or dark meat, whichever you prefer. 
                    Even if you're short on time, just a 10-minute soak in seasoned marinade mixture works wonders. 
                    Of course, you can leave the chicken to marinate — in the fridge — for up to 4 hours.</dt>
                    <p><dd><strong>Before searing</strong> your meat in the skillet, be sure and dab off excess moisture with paper towels. 
                        Drying the surface of the chicken helps to achieve the golden crust that makes fajitas so crave-worthy.</dd></p>

            <li>Scoring the Perfect Sear</li>
                <dl>
                    <dt>
                    Whether you're cooking chicken fajitas on the grill or the stove top, hitting the proper temperature is essential for juicy, tender meat with the right amount of char. If you're cooking whole chicken pieces, it's best to start in a fiery hot pan or grill to achieve the most flavorful meat, but then turning down the heat after flipping it when the first side turns golden, so it cooks through a little more slowly on the second side. Cooking strips goes more quickly, as long as you remember not to crowd the pan. After cooking, let the whole pieces rest for five minutes before carving and serving.</p>

            <li>The Supporting Cast
                <dl>
                    <dt>
                        <p>The sautéed veggies are nearly as important as the star attraction, so take a few minutes to do them up right. Thinly slice red, green, yellow, and orange bell peppers (either one or a mix of any of those) and sweet onions. Because the onions and peppers cook at different rates, you could fry them separately — say, the onions followed by the peppers and then mix those together before serving. Or, start with the onions and add the peppers after a few minutes. Again, don't crowd the pan, or your veggies will steam rather than caramelize. Add a sprinkle of fajita seasoning to the mix as it cooks to amp up the flavor.</p>
